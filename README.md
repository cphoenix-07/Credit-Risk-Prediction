**Credit Card Risk Assessment using XGBoost**

This repository hosts code for assessing credit card risk employing the XGBoost classifier. The process involves several stages:

**1. Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset using pandas.
   - Drop irrelevant columns like 'ID' and rename columns for consistency.
   - Map categorical variables to numerical values.
   - Scale the features using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity and aid model convergence.

**2. Hyperparameter Optimization:**
   - Use RandomizedSearchCV to optimize XGBoost hyperparameters.
   - Define a parameter grid containing ranges for parameters like learning rate, max depth, min child weight, gamma, and colsample by tree.
   - Perform a randomized search over the parameter grid to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
   - Utilize cross-validation to evaluate each hyperparameter setting.

**3. Model Training:**
   - Initialize an XGBoost classifier with default parameters.
   - Train the classifier using the best hyperparameters obtained from the optimization step.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation with 10 folds.

**4. Results Interpretation:**
   - Display the best hyperparameters identified by RandomizedSearchCV.
   - Calculate and print the mean cross-validation accuracy score, providing an estimate of the model's generalization performance.
   - Optionally, additional evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score can be computed to assess the model comprehensively.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python 3.x and required dependencies (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`).
3. Run the code in `credit_card_risk_assessment.ipynb`.
4. Analyze the results, model performance, and hyperparameter settings.
